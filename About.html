                <h4>Rosio Granados-Trejo</h4>
                <p>Founding Mother</p>
                <p>Rosio Granados Trejo was born in Omaha, Nebraska and is a proud older sister of seven. 
                She is also a first generation Mexican-American graduate from University of Nebraska-Omaha with a BS and BA. 
                Rosio has always been an avid believer and advocate for the importance of mental health and found her stress reliver through coffee. 
                When taking care of her own mental space, she would go out with her friends to chat and have coffee. 
                Rosio has been a barista for multiple franchises, including small local businesses and large known chains. 
                At some point she started to feel that there were not many places for Latinos to feel included, including herself. 
                Therefore, she started brewing up a plan of starting up a Mexican based coffee shop with other minds that thought alike. 
                Yasmin and Rosio reconnected after some time after high school. 
                Motivated by their dreams of being successful and connecting to their roots, the space of "Coffee Alley" was born.

                <h4>Yasmin</h4>
                <p>Founding Mother</p>
                <p>Yasmin is a first generation Mexican- American UNL graduate, born in California but raised in South Omaha since the age of three, attending both Omaha Bryan and Omaha South High. 
                She has always had a dream to be a coffee shop owner & when high school friend, Rosio, and her reconnected it was a mutual goal.
                They both have family from the Mexican state of Guanajuato. 
                El Callejón del Beso, The Kissing Alley, being such a well known site there, they both agreed on “El Callejón del Café” Coffee Alley.
